# HumanCode (formerly MonkeyCode)

Welcome to HumanCode, a web application that allows programmers to test and improve their typing speed using different programming languages.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), HumanCode offers a sleek and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for programmers to select a language and start typing.

To get started, simply visit our website and select the programming language you would like to practice. You will then be presented with a code snippet in that language and a text box to type in. As you type, HumanCode will track your progress and provide you with real-time feedback on your typing speed and accuracy.

In addition to the typing test, HumanCode also offers a variety of other features, such as the ability to save your progress and track your improvement over time. 

So what are you waiting for? Visit HumanCode today and start improving your typing skills!
